## Recommendations
I would advise AvidXchange to get into peer to peer transactions with mobile payment options similar to Cash App.
This would increase revenue and enhance AvidXchange's relevance in the consumer market.  Younger consumers are using mobile technology for banking at a rapid rate. Machine learning would be a technology that would be appropriate to this solution as it would learn the customers spending habits and could engage predictability to encourage future purchases. AvidXchange could use existing technology to process payments.
